        Conn., the son of Henry and Nancy Reynolds Bagley. His grandfather Richard
        Joshua Reynolds founded the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company in 1875. Mr. Bagley
        graduated from Washington and Lee University and served as a captain in the
        United States Army Reserve.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mr. Bagley, an heir to the
        R. J. Reynolds tobacco fortune, was chief executive of SBI, a cellular telephone
        company in Arizona, New Mexico and Colorado that he started in 1989. But much
        of his time was spent in philanthropic and public affairs work. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Mr.
        Bagley joined the Democratic Party when he was 17 and made an unsuccessful
        bid for a North Carolina seat in the House of Representatives in 1968. He
        later served as vice chairman of finance for the Democratic National Committee.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Among

        conspiring to manipulate the stock of a food and textile conglomerate, the
        Washington Group, to inflate its price artificially. A federal district court
        jury in Richmond, Va., acquitted them of the charges.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Besides
